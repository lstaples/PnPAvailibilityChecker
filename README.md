### PnPAvailibilityChecker

This is just a stupid simple script I wrote to automate checking availability for the Disney Pirates and Pals Voyage in Disneyland. The family is taking a trip next year and our dates are not yet availabile for booking.   I was tired of checking everyday so I wrote this and execute it daily from a scheduled task on my machine.

The script is specific to my needs but some of the things I eneded up having to figure out would be useful to anyone trying to scrape the Disney My Experience website.
